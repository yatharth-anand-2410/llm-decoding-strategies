    "# 7. Contrastive Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to one of the most brilliant State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) deterministic decoding methods: **Contrastive Search**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In notebooks 1-6, we explored the tension between **Determinism (Greedy, Beam)** and **Stochasticity (Temperature, Top-P)**.\n",
    "- **Greedy** was too boring and trapped itself in infinite loops.\n",
    "- **Top-P/Temperature** was wildly creative, but ran the risk of hallucination and incoherence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2022, researchers asked: *Can we get the high coherence of Greedy Decoding, without ever falling into a repetitive loop, but also without relying on random dice rolls?*\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer was Contrastive Search.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it works (The Math)\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrastive Search evaluates the top `K` most likely next words. For each word, it calculates a final score based on two competing factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Confidence:** How mathematically likely is this token? (We want this to be HIGH).\n",
    "2. **Degeneration Penalty:** How mathematically similar is the definition/embedding of this token to the definitions of the tokens we have *already* written? (We want this to be LOW).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{Score}(v) = (1 - \\alpha) \\times \\text{Confidence}(v) - \\alpha \\times \\text{Similarity}(v, \\text{past}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The hyperparameter $\\alpha$ (Alpha) balances the two. If $\\alpha = 0.0$, this is identical to Greedy Decoding. If $\\alpha = 1.0$, the model cares *only* about avoiding repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it uses **Cosine Similarity** on the deep neural states of the tokens, it understands synonyms! If you say \"The large dog\", it knows that \"big\" is mathematically similar to \"large\", and will penalize it, forcing the model to pick a more interesting word to keep the story moving forward."
